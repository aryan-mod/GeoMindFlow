# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AI-Based Rockfall Prediction & Alert System is a comprehensive, multi-tier architecture designed for high availability, scalability, and real-time performance. This document provides detailed technical specifications for each component.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service handles a specific domain
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can be scaled based on demand
- **Technology Diversity**: Best tool for each job
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade

### 2. Event-Driven Design
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket and MQTT messaging
- **Decoupled Components**: Pub/sub patterns
- **Scalable Processing**: Queue-based task distribution

### 3. Data-Centric Approach
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized data lake
- **Multi-Modal Data**: Images, time-series, spatial data
- **Data Lineage**: Full traceability of data flow
- **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing capabilities
